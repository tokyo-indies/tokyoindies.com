This month's event started out with a presentation by [Caras
Ohmi](https://twitter.com/CarasOhmi) of [Banraku
Games](http://banraku-games.sakura.ne.jp/) about their in-development game
[Rising Arch](http://banraku-games.sakura.ne.jp/RisingArch/index.html), a
shooting game controlled entirely with the mouse. A demo was distributed at
[Digigame Expo](http://digigame-expo.org/) and Comiket last year and can also
be played online [here](http://banraku-games.sakura.ne.jp/RisingArchTrial/index.html). For an
early demo it's already got a high degree of polish and is fun to play; this is
one to keep an eye on.

Next up, [Saebashi](https://twitter.com/saebashi) showed his in-development
[Tokoyo no Tou](http://commentout.info/tokoyo/), a
platformer where the world is regenerated every day. The randomly generated
world is the same for all players, like daily seeds seen in games like Spelunky
or Nuclear Throne, and the game is planned to include light social elements
such as leaving warning messages for other players. Saebashi also shared his
perspective on coming to game development in Unity from a background as a
designer. He had one critical piece of advice for people starting game dev: go
to game jams! It's a great place to learn what's involved in making a game and
meet people who have skills you don't.

Next [Hako](https://twitter.com/clrfnd) showed off the side-scrolling
adventure game he's working on, Unreal Life. The main character is a girl who
lost her memories, and can regain them by touching objects in the mysterious
world she finds herself in with the help of a talking traffic light. For Tokyo
Indie Fest he'll be releasing a demo with one chapter to play, as well as
showing his currently available [Color
Finder](http://hakolife.net/colorfinder/), a block-pushing puzzle game with
color based mechanics and lovely pixel art.

The last presentation this month was a post-mortem of [Strange
Telephone](http://magniflop.com/st) by [Yuta](https://twitter.com/yyuta342).
Strange Telephone is an adventure game about navigating a mysterious universe
by dialing phone numbers to travel to different worlds, currently available for
iOS and Android.

Yuta cited [Yume Nikki](http://www3.nns.ne.jp/pri/tk-mto/) and
[LSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD_%28video_game%29) (the game) as major
influences in making Strange Telephone. Reflecting on what went well, he noted
that the game struck a chord with Yumi Nikki fans, which helped sales and
resulted in great positive feedback. Besides fans of Yume Nikki praising the
feel of the game, the art was also widely well reviewed. He was also fortunate
to have a lot of fan art made of the characters from the game. Materially
speaking, the game sold well enough he could quit his day job and become a
full-time independent game developer.

Summarizing negative feedback he recieved about the game, a lot of people felt
it was too short, just didn't get what it was about, found it boring, or
thought it was too expensive. (For reference, the game sells for 480 yen). 

Finally he discussed some of his plans going forward, including working on
producing goods, releasing the game on Steam, and adding more content and
language support. It's a lot to look forward to!

That was it for this month's Tokyo Indies, catch you next month! ðŸŽ®
