Happy New Year Indies! Here's what happened this month:

The [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/) is taking place January 20-22; there's still time to get in if you're interested.

[Hawken King](https://twitter.com/hawkun) presented a game made for the Nintendo Disk System!! He created a cartridge based on the soundtrack for his recently released game, [Pirate Pop Plus](http://store.steampowered.com/app/487350/).

Martin from Ninja Egg presented [Kyub](http://ninja-egg.com/kyub/), their action puzzle game available on XBox One and Windows. Using the power of elements and your brain you have to guide a cube through a series of bizarre and beautiful environments.

[Ryosuke Mihara](https://twitter.com/oinariman) talked about the [Pico-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) [Tiny TV Jam](http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=28480), in progress until the 22nd.

That was all this month, catch you next time!
