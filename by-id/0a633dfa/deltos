This month before presentations we had two quick announcements:

- A new book about Unity network programming in Japanese will be released on 6/19, get it on [Amazon](http://amzn.asia/2Jue7UA).
- Tribal Siege, presented at Tokyo Indies long ago as a Greenlight project, is in Early Access! Check it out on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/558720/Tribal_Siege/).

The first game up is [Shaky Butt](http://shakybutt.com), an in
development rhythm game by [AureliaX0](https://twitter.com/AureliaX0) with
music by [Rekcahdam](https://twitter.com/rekcahdam). Your goal is to travel
around the galaxy and win Simon-Says style dance matches.

Next up, [ksym](https://twitter.com/mt_kuso) showed off
[UTU](http://utu.ksym.jp/), a mobile rythm game he released recently, and his
in-development title Karate Stairs. The basic idea of UTU is to take everything
modern mobile music games do and do the opposite. For Karate Stairs, the game
is about enjoying throwing a ragdoll model down a flight of stairs. He also
showed off some of his previous games and other projects; you can check them
all out at his [homepage](http://ksym.jp).

Shooter](https://www.freem.ne.jp/win/game/15000), a free PC shooting game with
mouse controls he released recently. Right click to set the gravity anchor for
your ship and left click to shoot. There are a variety of powerups and enemies
to interact with - give it a look!

creators. 

That was it for this month - catch you next time! ðŸŽ®
