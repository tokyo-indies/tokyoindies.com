Tokyo Indies is monthly gathering for people working on or interested in indie games in Tokyo.

!img C2XrhXBVQAAMGrm.jpg [Hawken King](https://twitter.com/hawkun) gives the first presentation of 2017.

At Tokyo Indies game developers, creators, artists and game fans can hang out
and share their passion for games over a few (or more) friendly drinks.  No
matter your calling, be you indie, doujin, student, corporate or wookiee,
whether you love making games or just playing them, all are welcome! We offer
time and space to present your games or just display them for feedback and from
time to time we will host unique speakers and guests. 

If you'd like to attend the event, registration is not required and you can come and go at any time. 

If you'd like to present a game you're working on, please use the application form [here](/present.en.html).
