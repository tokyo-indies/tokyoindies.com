This month at Tokyo Indies we had robots, sushi, and strange birds - read on for more details!

First [Makoto Goto](https://twitter.com/squashsesame) announced the [7th Serious Games Jam](http://www.mediadesignlabs.org/SGJ7/). The theme this year is "Acessibility for Everybody", and the jam will be held in Jinbocho in December. 

[Alvin Phu](https://twitter.com/datponpon), founder of Tokyo Indies, talked about how he integrated the [Mightier](https://mightier.com/) platform, designed to teach children emotional control, into his game Peko Peko Sushi.

[Takumi Wada](https://twitter.com/takumiwada129) presented his game [Upside Down](http://takumi0129.php.xdomain.jp) based on the theme of "reversal". By switching between day and night you can capture oni and make them your teammates. The game is designed to let you experience by turns the horror of running from a powerful monster and the power of crushing helpless foes.

[Ichijo](https://twitter.com/ttwcodeout) showed off [Demolition Robots KK](http://throwthewarpedcodeout.com/2018/09/12/demolition-robots-k-k/), a multiplayer game where instead of fighting directly giant robots compete to destroy the most buildings.

[Horou-sama](https://twitter.com/tolune) presented [Êúù„ÅØ„Å©„Åì]() ("Where is the Morning"), a post apocalyptic hack-and-slash action game developed with the goal of being relaxing.

Finally [Yoshiro Kimura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-teYMMF4owM) of [Onion Games](https://twitter.com/oniongames) gave a post mortem of their recently released [Black Bird](http://oniongames.jp/blackbird/). A shooting game with deeply integrated music, he talked about the difficulty of coordinating composition and level design and went into some detail on the unique tools they developed.
