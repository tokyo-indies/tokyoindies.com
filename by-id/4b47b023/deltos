Next up [jnhtt](https://twitter.com/guapo88888) showed off his [Grass Cut
Race](http://smartphone-games.net/), a cart racer for smartphones. In addition
to fine-tuned cart action, driving the same route allows you to go faster on
subsequent laps since the grass is gone, adding an element of planning.
