As winter sets in we gathered for the last Tokyo Indies of 2018. This time we
had RPGs, a technical talk, kingdom building, and a mysterious desert. Read on
to learn more!

First up [Nanyon](https://twitter.com/TriTrust3) presented TriTrust 3, the
latest in an RPG series he's been working on for some years. His goals with
this game are to make the game systems as transparent as possible, providing
strategic challenge without being stressful. He's posted links to in-progress
builds on his Twitter if you're interested.

[Nathan](https://twitter.com/NathanGDquest) introduced the open-source game
engine [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and talked about using it to develop
an RPG called [GDQuest](http://gdquest.com/).

Takada of Wonderland Kazakiri gave a brief introduction to their game [Block
Quest Maker](http://bqm.blk-quest.com/) and then discussed the technical merits
of [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/). Block Quest Maker allows you to create
dungeons and share them with your friends, and MessagePack is used on the
backend to send data between servers compactly.

[Puzzle and
Monarch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/puzzle-monarch/id1397142472?mt=8)
is a recent released puzzle game for iOS by [Nobuyuki
Nishiyama](https://twitter.com/5mingame2). You have thirty seconds to build a
peaceful countryside out of tiles while trying to earn maximum points. It's
free so definitely give it a look!

Finally Matt Smith of [Friend and Foe](https://twitter.com/FriendAndFoeDev)
presented [Vane](http://www.friendandfoegames.com/vane/). Vane was
presented at Tokyo Indies a few years ago and will be released in January. Matt
talked about the difficulties of development and what you should prioritize.
