Before presentations this month there was one special announcement - [Digi Game
Expo](http://digigame-expo.org/) still has a few spaces open and is recruiting
staff, so check that out if you're available.

First up [Makoto Goto](https://twitter.com/SquashSesame) gave a presentation
about the [Fukushima Game Jam](http://fgj.igda.jp/). After his younger brother
lost his house in the tragedy at Fukushima, he wanted to do what he could to
support reconstruction efforts through game development. Since then the
Fukushima Game Jam has grown to have locations all around the world. This
year's event will be held this weekend, and while the main venue in Fukushima
is full many venues are still accepting applicants - check the site for a full
list!

[Bitslap](https://twitter.com/slapmybitsup) from Sweden presented [Frog
Tale](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=44829.0), a game he's been
working on since 2014. Using just two buttons - jump left and jump right - you
play a frog on a great journey.

[Kaho Abe](https://twitter.com/kahodesu) from New York presented several of her
physical games using unique controllers and play styles. She also demonstrated
her game [Shake It Up](http://kahoabe.net/?portfolio=shake-it-up), where you
shake a soda can and try to pick it up before the other players, but not too
fast.

[Liam Edwards](https://twitter.com/LiamBME), formerly of Rockstar Games, showed
off Salaryman Suzuki-san, his in-development game about a salaryman getting to
work on his first day. There were lasers.
