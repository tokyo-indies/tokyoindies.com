We started out with some announcements. First, the [Tokyo Game Music Show](http://www.88nite.com/tgms2017/) will be held Saturday, February 25 at Ariake Differ, featuring performances and releases by both experienced and new composers. 

In April, the [Smartphone Game Festival](https://www.sgfes.net/) will be held near Jimbocho station on the 15th and 16th. It's similar to other events like DigiGame Festa but focused specifically on smartphone games.

[Yahya Danboos](http://www.yahyadanboos.com/) showed off his in-development VR game [Crystals of Azaria](http://www.yahyadanboos.com/lavendria-vr), a fantasy adventure game designed around the limitations of movement in VR. As you navigate a deadly maze, stepping in the wrong place deals you damage before you would bump into the physical limits of your VR space.

Next up was [Last Standard](http://www.i-fromjapan.com/), a third-person action game where your characters abilities are based on analyzing the text of your Twitter account or a short personality quiz. There's some English coverage of the game [here](https://news.qoo-app.com/81065/).
