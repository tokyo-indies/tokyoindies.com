The first presentation this month was [Flap Trip](http://peculia.jp/products/flaptrip/), a simple but vicious puzzle game for [iOS](http://peculia.jp/products/flaptrip://appstore.com/peculiallc/flaptrip) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.peculia.flapper). You have to collect stars on the screen while dodging bullets and enemies - but unfortunately you're very heavy and control each wing separately! It's kind of a combination of [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html) and Flappy Bird.

Next up [TPM.CO Soft Works](http://www.tpmcosoft.com/) discussed [Busan Indie Connect](http://bicfest.org/) and the [Taipei Game Show](http://taipeigameshow.biz/guide.php?lang=e), where he showed off his in-development [Tarotica Voodoo](http://www.tpmcosoft.com/msx/tarotica.shtml). Both events provide funding for overseas attendees and aren't that far away, so they're definitely worth keeping in mind as good venues for showing off projects.

Finally developers from [Shindenken](http://www.shindenken.org/) showed off some of their games. [Virus Crashers](http://store.steampowered.com/app/584600) is a one-screen platforming action game that would be at home on the NES, while Agartha (video below) is a side-scrolling adventure with advanced particle effects reminiscent of a [falling sand game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling-sand_game). Though they didn't get chance to show it, they also recently released [Kamio Recoil](http://store.steampowered.com/app/557420/) in English on Steam, so give that a look.
