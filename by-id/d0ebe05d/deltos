Happy New Year! Tokyo Indies wishes all of you a great 2018. This month started
off with great presentations - read on to find out about them!

First up Coallin Xuan gave a presentation about how to sell games in China.
Since going through government censors is mandatory a publisher is legally
required. While this has historically been a burden for Indies, TenCent has a
new program to make it easier to get started.

Dungeon Rankers by Dead.Fish.Eye is a roguelike for
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DFE.DungeonRankers1)
and
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/dungeon-rankers/id1321327744?l=ja&ls=1&mt=8).
Unlike most traditional roguelikes, your goal isn't to reach the bottom of the
dungeon, but instead to beat out 98 NPCs in a battle royale.
