First up this month was [DNA Softwares](http://www.dna-softwares.com/)
presenting their New Standard Mahjong. While they're previously made an
anything-goes Touhou mahjong game, this time they decided to make a game that
could be played seriously using standard rules. That didn't prevent them from
adding options for more unusual rules or Unity-chan though.

Next up NOEL presented [Legend of Networks](http://noelgame.html.xdomain.jp).
While taking inspiration from classic strategy games, it actually began as a
collaboration between members of a research group as a project to build an
interesting AI. A [demo](http://noelgame.html.xdomain.jp/game/) is available
and they're aiming for release at Comiket.
