Thanks to all our regulars and special overseas visitors for coming by! Thanks also to WBS for coming by for a segment on [game creators](http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/mv/wbs/feature/post_141644/). Also thanks to everyone who came to the [IGDA Localization Roundtable](http://tgs-roundatable.peatix.com/) before the event!
