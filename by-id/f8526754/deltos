Next up, [Luis Garcia](https://twitter.com/shinyuden) presented his game [Bazookrash](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=848690643). In Bazookrash, the main character is the bear Morlando, who snaps after noisy cars in his neighborhood keep him from sleeping at night. Your objective is to use a bazooka to blow up the noisy cars.

After that [Kero XP](https://twitter.com/keroxp) showed off his in-development mobile game [ARIKA the black wing](http://hexat.studio/arika). In the game, you control girls with wings flying upwards while avoiding obstacles. He also showed the custom animation system he developed to give the characters a variety of facial expressions and natural movement.
