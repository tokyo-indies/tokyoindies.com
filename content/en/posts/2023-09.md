Tokyo Indies this month will be held on September 20th, right before the [Tokyo Game Show](https://tgs.nikkeibp.co.jp/tgs/2023/jp/). TGS always brings many visitors from overseas, and we're expecting more than the usual number of participants. For that reason we have a few special rules this time.

First, while anyone is welcome to apply to present, we'll be prioritizing presentations from developers based in Japan, in particular those who are unable to exhibit at TGS for whatever reason. 

Second, since we expect the venue to be crowded, we're requesting anyone wanting to do a demo at the event pre-register using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc01_04OSS-2Ab9BqwRNLCFjunoAJg-ePWdkJlKG1Xy1WL5bg/viewform). 

We look forward to seeing you at the event!
