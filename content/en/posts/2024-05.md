The next Tokyo Indies will be held on May 15.

It will also be ten years since the first Tokyo Indies, so the organizer Alvin will be giving a presentation on Tokyo Indies!

We're accepting presentations as usual on the [presentation page](/en/present) if you're interested.

Also, June's Tokyo Indies will have a visual novel/adventure game theme!
