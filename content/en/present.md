Tokyo Indies welcomes presenters each month. You can apply to present even if it's your first time at the event, and in-development games are welcome.

Exhibiting your game on an open table at the event is also encouraged, and pre-registration is NOT required (please do not fill out this form). However, please note table space is limited and first-come first-serve.

## About Presentations

- Presentations begin around 20:30
- Presentations should be roughly 5 minutes long
- We have a PC you can present from, please inquire for details

For more information, see [the FAQ](/en/faq). If something is unclear, please apply anyway and we can discuss things in mail. Also, please do not send us machine-translated Japanese - we speak English!
