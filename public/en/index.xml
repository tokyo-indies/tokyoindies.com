      <description>Tokyo Indies this month will be held on September 20th, right before the Tokyo Game Show. TGS always brings many visitors from overseas, and we&amp;rsquo;re expecting more than the usual number of participants. For that reason we have a few special rules this time.
First, while anyone is welcome to apply to present, we&amp;rsquo;ll be prioritizing presentations from developers based in Japan, in particular those who are unable to exhibit at TGS for whatever reason.</description>

      <description>This page covers many commonly asked questions about Tokyo Indies. If something isn&amp;rsquo;t clear, feel free to get in touch.
What is the event like? The event is mainly indie devs casually hanging out in a bar. Anyone is welcome to set up a demo of their game at an empty table, so it&amp;rsquo;s a good opportunity to see what&amp;rsquo;s in development or get feedback on a prototype. Starting from 8:30 for roughly one hour, there will be presentations by a few developers in the basement club space.</description>
