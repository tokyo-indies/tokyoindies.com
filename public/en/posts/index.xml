      <description>Tokyo Indies this month will be held on September 20th, right before the Tokyo Game Show. TGS always brings many visitors from overseas, and we&amp;rsquo;re expecting more than the usual number of participants. For that reason we have a few special rules this time.
First, while anyone is welcome to apply to present, we&amp;rsquo;ll be prioritizing presentations from developers based in Japan, in particular those who are unable to exhibit at TGS for whatever reason.</description>
